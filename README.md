## My process

  I started out with a youtube video of someone else doing this challenge and then put the challenge away, unfinished for a couple of months while I worked on other projects. I came back to it recently and ended up re-writing most of the code I started with using the things I learned from a few vidoes and info from w3schools. The intention is to get a more familiarity with using classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I'm getting better at understanding and using classes and still getting a feel for responsiveness.
I'd really benifit from advice on best practices in ordering/organinzing my css and classes to make
the code easier to read. All advice and input welcome!!!

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) - I really like w3schools and their resources.
